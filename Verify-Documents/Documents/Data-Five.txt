ere, the hash begins with eight zeros! You can assume that whoever presented you with heads750 had to commit at least some
computational resources to calculate many hashes in order to find
an input that produced a hash with such a pattern. We call this a
proof of work. Even more work has probably been spent in order
to find the following input, as its hash begins with 12 zeros:
Proof of work can be used to make attacks more difficult. For example, by requesting users to present proof of work before making a
request, a server can make it more expensive for attackers to overload it with bogus requests. The attackers would have to spend a
lot of computational resources in order to create piles of requests
that the server would accept to process
 Along with digital signatures and hashing, proof of
work gave rise to a technology that is set to change the world: the
blockchain! Over the next few years, we believe it can provide economic sovereignty to billions of people by eliminating middlemen
and adding more transparency, privacy and accountability to our
society. Along with blockchain, entirely new cryptographic tools
with fancy names are being developed, such as “zero-knowledge
proofs” and “homomorphic encryption”. We can only dream of the
power that will be unleashed by these technologies in the future
