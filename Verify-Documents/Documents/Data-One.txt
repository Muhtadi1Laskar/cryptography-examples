Most computer systems authenticate users by requesting them to
enter a password. This means that they must store records of all
passwords. But keeping plaintext copies of passwords is terrible
practice: if the system is hacked, the passwords of every user can
potentially be known to the hackers. In addition, many people have
the bad habit of reusing their passwords, so such a security breach
in one system can lead to breaches in other systems.
Storing encrypted passwords doesn’t solve the problem. With
complete access to a system, attackers can potentially find the key
and figure out how the system automatically encrypts or decrypts
passwords when verifying login attempts. At this point, everyone’s
encrypted password can then potentially be decrypted!
For this reason, it’s better to store the hash of each password
rather than an encrypted copy: contrarily to ciphers, hash functions
are not reversible. However, you can still check the password provided at login by hashing it and comparing it to the hash you’re
storing. If the hashes are the same, the password is correct.17 Yet,
even if a computer system is only storing password hashes, there’s
still a way for attackers to know people’s passwords
