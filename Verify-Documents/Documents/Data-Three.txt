Fortunately, there is a way to prevent dictionary attacks.
Instead of saving the result of hash(password) to a database, the
system can generate a random number called a salt and store it in
plaintext along with the result of hash(password+salt). Since
each user has salt different salt, this forces the attackers to try and
brute force each password hash individually. Every time they try to
find the password of a given user, they donâ€™t even know if that user
has a simple password that would take minutes to brute force or a
complicated one that could take centuries
