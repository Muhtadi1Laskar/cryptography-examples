Attackers can compute the hashes of trillions of
arbitrary passwords and create a sort of dictionary that maps hashes
back to plaintext passwords. Stolen password hashes can then be
looked up in this dictionary. This is a sort of brute force attack,
but the work has to be done only once. Itâ€™s effective because most
people use simple passwords. In 2012 a hacker attacked LinkedIn
and leaked the password hashes of over 6 million people; and a dictionary attack could reveal most of them. Storing password hashes
can be almost as bad as storing plain copies of the passwords
